### For Healthy Books


* Have a book properly restored before it gets worse.

* Keep books out of extreme elements (concentrated lighting, direct sunlight, high heat, smoky areas).

* Store books in environmentally controlled areas.

* Store tall and large books or books with flexible covers by laying them flat rather than standing.

* Do not store books in plastic, brown paper, or newspaper.

* Clean leather books periodically with a slightly damp, soft cloth. No other treatment is needed if book is still 
functional.

* Wrap a book in a towel then place in plastic bag, squeezing out the air, if bugs/insects, active molds, or mildew are 
noticedâ€”or if book is wet. Place in the freezer, preferably a deep freeze.

* Avoid using books for storage of things like newspaper clippings, pressed flowers, keepsakes, etc.

* Take a book from a shelf by pushing back the neighboring books and gripping the book at the spine. Pick up a book with 
both covers closed or supported. Avoid taking hold of any book at the top of the spine.

* Avoid placing Bibles or study books in the side pockets of carrying cases with handles. And, don't carry the books 
using the handles. Best to carry in arms providing support to book and especially the spine.

* Avoid home repairs on books, such as use of cellophane, duct tape, or masking tape on tears or to repair covers; as 
well as glue in spine or on covers or painting soiled areas. Consult a qualified bookbinder. If unsure about a binder 
being qualified, ask to see samples of their work and/or obtain references.
