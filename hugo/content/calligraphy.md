Calligraphy comes from "kalligraphos" -- which means "beautiful writing". 
Catherine's journey in hand lettering began as a child learning lettering forms in elementary school using Speedball nibs and India ink. 
She fell in love with doing hand lettering and was always on call for making posters and signs. 
In the mid-1970s she began formal training and has done calligraphy professionally in the years since. 
She continues to take opportunities to further her education and skills in the field.

                This illuminated "E" was outlined using waterproof black ink and the inner areas painted with metallic gold 
                Winsor-Newton gouache. The vines were also done with the black ink, and gouache served as the medium for the 
                flowers and leaves.

                A letterform based on an alphabet designed by Frederich Neugebauer became the alphabet used in this 
                accordian-folded book, done in gouache. The verses of "Texas, Our Texas" were enhanced with collage and Texas 
                commemorative postage stamps. The covers were done with sapphire goat leather with braided red-white-blue ties.

                This framed work in calligraphy with its four open windows was hand lettered on Guterburg Laid paper 
                using gouache in the colors of the commemorative postage stamp. The stamp was issued in 2003 and 
                commemorated the Wright Brothers' First Flight of the Kitty Hawk. The sheet of stamps included the historical 
                data on its back side and is the text for the lettering to its right.
