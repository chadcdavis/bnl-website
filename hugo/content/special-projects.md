                <h4>Texas Counties Book</h4>
                <p>A large book of all the counties in Texas had many tattered, torn pages, such as this one. Some mends were done, edges flattened, and whole pages encapsulated using special technique with sheer Tengujo tissue.</p>

                <p>A miniature book should be no more than 3" vertically or horizontally. These three miniature books are smaller than that. The black one has a leather cover, the cream colored one is all paper, and the smallest one is 3/4" square with a folded paper cover.</p>
