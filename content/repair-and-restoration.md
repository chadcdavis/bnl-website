Usually there is more than one option for repairing a book. Various procedures will be explained and discussed with you, so it can be decided which procedures fit the needs of your projects and budget. Estimates are available for repairs and restoration projects. Please call or email to schedule a consultation, 214.363.7946 or bookltrs@att.net.
